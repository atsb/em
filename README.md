# MERGES

This branch contains all the versions of 'em' I could find in my UNIX archives.

I will carefully apply as many patches into Master from Merges as I think should be applied.  Some
are not possible to be merged fully at they conflict with eachother against what is enabled, changed or disabled.

The goal is to create the 'definitive em' with as many features as possible.  Priority is below.

1. CUNY - This will be merged first, it's clean and very similar to the current master version.
2. KENT - Secondary as it has many differences and added features that will require testing.
3. AUSAM - Some patches will be applied but not all.  The structure has been totally rewritten and many changes
  have been done, especially to the screen reader 'o' mode.  Since I want to improve this mode, I'll be using this one
  mostly for that feature.  This will be the hardest to apply.
  
I won't be doing the Wollongong patches as this was only for the specifics of their Unix machine on their campus (Interdata Unix) as this had changes to I/O and Registers.
